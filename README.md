"CloudProfile is a cloud-based application I developed that allows users to update and manage their profiles. Itâ€™s fully containerized using Docker, hosted on AWS ECR, and integrated with a MongoDB database. When users update their profiles, the changes sync instantly with the database.

I worked on:

Backend API Development with Node.js for profile updates.
Database Management with MongoDB for storing user profiles.
Dockerization to containerize the application for easy deployment.
AWS ECR for securely storing and deploying the Docker images.
Cloud-based Profile Management System, allowing real-time updates and syncing with the database.
This project showcases my ability to build, containerize, and deploy scalable web applications using cloud infrastructure."**
